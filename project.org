** What is the SSD of the rest of the nodes for each UC ?
** What is the SSD of the remaining nodes after covering top r UCs ?
** What can we say about the rest of nodes i.e. the nodes which are not part of UCs ?
** Can we reduce the graph to smaller ensemble by aligning the UCs according to their freq distribution ?
** What is the composition of UCs calculated by AM and LAM?
*** Can we count number of 3,4,5 size UCS ?
*** Can plot the difference between the size of UCs found for LAM and AM ?
*** Can we compute the jaccard index for similarity in nodes for LAM and AM ?
*** Can we put ucs in equivalence class ? Find the counts of equivalence classes ?
