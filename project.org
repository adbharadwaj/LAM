* Pending tasks
** TODO Organize the project directory
** TODO Commit the project to Group's SVN Repo
** TODO Generate graphs for each of the data-sets
** TODO Write script to compare files line by lines to compare results.
** TODO Do profiling
* Questions
** What is the SSD of the rest of the nodes for each UC ?
** What is the SSD of the remaining nodes after covering top r UCs ?
** What can we say about the rest of nodes i.e. the nodes which are not part of UCs ?
** Can we reduce the graph to smaller ensemble by aligning the UCs according to their freq distribution ?
** What is the composition of UCs calculated by AM and LAM?
*** Can we count number of 3,4,5 size UCS ?
*** Can plot the difference between the size of UCs found for LAM and AM ?
*** Can we compute the jaccard index for similarity in nodes for LAM and AM ?
*** Can we put ucs in equivalence class ? Find the counts of equivalence classes ?
* Instructions
** Input file
** Output file
** Generating UCs
** Generating graphs
* 19 November
** Refactor code to do multiple things by command line. Write code in such a way that you can run simulations from shell script. No hardcoding at all.
